I have more than 2 years of experience in working in the banking sector as an economist. In the maternity leave I have decided to change my professional occupation and to try myself in the IT sector. I have a great interest in the frontend developing, because I've always been interested in coding and I like to see the visible result. I also enjoy overcoming challenges. I'm eager to learn and have a great willing to obtain necessary technical skills from this course.
